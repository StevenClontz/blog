> Steven Clontz is the best professor I've had at Auburn thus far.

Gonna brag a little. Here's some excerpts from my student evaulation comments.

<!-- more -->

(I taught Calculus III (MATH 2630) this past spring, which means I had mostly engineering, math/sci, and math ed students.)

> Great teacher. One of those teachers that you just can't help but like. Very good with explanations, examples, meeting outside of class. Truly there for the students.

> Keep up the great work! War Eagle!

> Best math teacher I have ever had.

> Mr. Clontz has easily been one of the best instructors I have had in Auburn in every aspect. He makes Calculus about as enjoyable as one could make it. His teaching techniques really helped me to learn the material that much easier. He provides plenty of examples and he leaves no room for doubt for how he makes his test. He creates a study guide that even lists how he gives partial credit so that way there is no room for error. Outside of class he was very easy to approach which was nice for me since I have never been one to visit teachers outside of class but he encourages you to and was very flexible. Mr. Clontz is definitely someone I would recommend to future students.

> Really good communication with class. Excellent resources provided online.
