This page (currently a work-in-progress) serves as my portfolio of web design and development. My full resume can also be found at <http://resume.stevenclontz.com>.

## StevenClontz.com

My most obvious work is, of course, the website you are on! This site runs using [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) using a slight variation on its "Classic" theme. I've also integrated [MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org/) for beautifully typeset $\LaTeX$ formulas.

$$ O \uparrow \text{Con}_{O,P}(X,x) $$

$$ V = \int_a^b A(x)\,dx $$

## Auburn University Bands

From 2007 until 2010 I served as the Webmaster and later Graduate Technology Assistant of the Auburn University Bands. The site was powered by [WordPress.org](http://wordpress.org/) with a custom theme I created to match the Auburn University web template at the time.

An as-is snapshot of the site's front page before my successor moved the Auburn Band to its [new CMS](http://www.auburn.edu/auband/) is currently archived at <http://web8v.auburn.edu/band/>.

## AU Graduate Student Council

Before serving as the President of AU's graduate student government, I served in the Webmaster executive officer position from 2010-2011. The GSC lacked a website of any kind, so I adapted the [Wolf CMS](http://www.wolfcms.org/) framework and and the current [AU official web template](http://www.auburn.edu/template/) to create a powerful website which could be maintained completely through a web browser.

The GSC still uses the the platform I created as of the date of this writing (2013-03-06), which is viewable at <http://auburn.edu/gsc>.

## Teloga Musician Networks

In 2012, [James Dabbs](http://www.jdabbs.com) and I cofounded **Teloga Musician Networks**, an online social network for helping music orgnaizations (such as high school or university band programs) manage their membership. The current incarnation of the site is based on the [Django framework](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and an adaptation of the [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) theme.

We are currently refactoring the site from scratch, and will release a [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) based redesign sometime in 2013.

## Puzzle Console

Part of my efforts in organizing the fifth [Auburn Puzzle Party puzzlehunt competition](http://auburnpuzzleparty.wikia.com/wiki/APP5) involved cocreating an online puzzle delivery and scoring platform based on the Django Framework along with James Dabbs.

The source to our [puzzle-console](https://github.com/jamesdabbs/puzzle-console) is freely available on GitHub. An archive of the site is available at <http://app5.jdabbs.com>.
