Thanks for checking out my blog! My name is Steven Clontz, and I'm a [mathematician](http://math.auburn.edu)  / [teacher](http://math.auburn.edu) / [hacker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_(programmer_subculture)) / [puzzle designer](http://auburnpuzzleparty.wikia.com) from Auburn, Alabama.

###Life

I grew up in the suburbs outside Huntsville, Alabama, and attended [Buckhorn High School](http://www.madison.k12.al.us/buckhorn/website/). I moved to Auburn, Alabama to attend [Auburn University](http://auburn.edu) and have stayed here happily ever since.

While she also grew up in Huntsville, I first met my wife Jessica in Auburn in 2009. We married in June 2011, and look forward to many happy years together. Jessica is an elementary school teacher in the Auburn City school system.

###Mathematics

My academic pursuits have been largely mathematical, and I graduated from Auburn as a University Honors Scholar with my undergrad thesis in discrete geometry studying the unfoldings of convex polyhedra. I later earned my Masters from Auburn in set-theoretic topology studying linearly ordered topological spaces. I currently am a doctoral candidate at Auburn, continuing in set-theoretic topology and investigating Ï‰-length topological games and characterizing various topological properties by the existence of winning limited information strategies within such games.

In addition to my topological research, I enjoy recreational mathematics and puzzles of various types, and frequent [/r/math](http://reddit.com/r/math/) and [/r/learnmath](http://reddit.com/r/learnmath/) on Reddit.

I was lucky to have the opportunity to develop the first mathematical puzzle solving competition for middle schoolers (that I know of!) along with [Braxton Carrigan](https://www.southernct.edu/search/directories/profile/?id=49445) and Auburn's [COSAM Outreach office](http://www.auburn.edu/cosam/departments/outreach/). Our event is called the [A.M.P.'d Challenge](http://www.auburn.edu/cosam/departments/outreach/programs/AMPd/index.htm), short for Auburn Mathematical Puzzle Competition. During each event, a [wacky villain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWh-5RBg4Z8) pulls off a crime, and by solving math puzzles, players can collect puzzle pieces which when put together reveal the method of the crime. 

###Web Development and Coding

I've had the opportunity to serve as the webmaster for several groups over the years, including the [Auburn University Bands](http://band.auburn.edu) and [AU Graduate Student Council](http://auburn.edu/gsc/).

I started a small online business with my friend [James Dabbs](http://jdabbs.com) called [Teloga](http://teloga.com), a musician networking service connecting musicians with their organizations. It's used for online registration and management of music personnel - we think it's pretty neat.

James and I also collaborated on the open-source [Puzzle Party Console](https://github.com/jamesdabbs/puzzle-console) to be used for organizing and running puzzlehunt competitions. Feel free to hack away if you find that sort of thing interesting!

###Teaching and Leadership

Teaching has been a passion of mine since participating in Whitefire Junior Leadership Training at Camp Westmoreland in 2002. I went on to spend the next decade serving Whitefire JLT and [National Youth Leadership Training](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Youth_Leadership_Training) camps in almost every position available as both a youth and adult leader. (While on topic, I am also a proud Eagle Scout!)

I am blessed to have the opportunity to instruct mathematics at Auburn University while pursuing my PhD. I have taught Calculus I, II, and III multiple times, as well as instructing a senior-level Euclidean geometry course in Summer 2011. I also have privately tutored many students for college placement exams and college courses.

I had the honor of serving as Webmaster for the [AU Graduate Student Council](http://auburn.edu/gsc/) in 2010-11, and as its President in 2011-12. I try to stay actively involved in university affairs and strive to serve my fellow classmates however I can.

###Music

Beginning in middle school and lasting through my undergraduate career, I was an active participant in Marching and Concert Band, playing the trombone. I know enough piano to hurt myself, and am known to sing too loudly in church on Sundays.

I was proud to be a member of the [Auburn University Bands](http://band.auburn.edu), serving as a R.A.T. (Rookie Auburn Tiger) Leader as a student, and later on staff as their webmaster and Graduate Technology Assistant.

###Puzzles

I first got involved with the puzzling community in Auburn in the summer of 2009 when my friend Charles McPillan and I secretly created the [Auburn Puzzler](http://auburnpuzzleparty.wikia.com/wiki/Auburn_Puzzler), an enigmatic entity responsible for weekly puzzlehunts throughout the summer.

After winning [Auburn Puzzle Party 3](http://auburnpuzzleparty.wikia.com/wiki/APP3) I organized the first "Puzzle Patrol" event in 2010 along with its sequel in 2012: Auburn Puzzle Parties [4](http://auburnpuzzleparty.wikia.com/wiki/APP4) and [5](http://auburnpuzzleparty.wikia.com/wiki/APP5). I also regularly participate in area [Puzzle Potlucks](http://auburnpuzzleparty.wikia.com/wiki/PP2). Most recently I joined a group collaborating to solve the fourth face of the [Kryptos structure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kryptos) at the CIA headquarters.

####Thanks for visiting!

It's been a while since I hosted a website for myself, tending to keep my [Facebook](http://facebook.com/stevenclontz) more up to date. But it can't hurt to have my own place to share my projects and thoughts.
