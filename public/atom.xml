    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A project that had been almost as long overdue as reviving <a href="http://www.stevenclontz.com">http://www.stevenclontz.com</a> was updating my neglected resume.</p>

<p>The tl;dr version: check it out at <a href="http://resume.stevenclontz.com">http://resume.stevenclontz.com</a>! But if you think that looks nice and would like to check out the web app that powers it, please read on. :-)</p>

<p>I knew I wanted my resume to be web-first. The last time I wrote a resume (back in early 2011) I had TeX&#8217;d it up locally. And hey, at least that&#8217;s better than a Word document, right? However, and maybe I&#8217;ve gotten lazier in the past two years&#8230; trudging through this didn&#8217;t seem appealing:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>\begin{ressection}{Education}
</span><span class='line'>    \begin{ressubsec}{Auburn University}{Auburn, AL}{Bachelor's of Science and Master of Science in Mathematics}
</span><span class='line'>        \ressubitem{Undergraduate GPA: 3.88 (overall), 4.00 (Major)}
</span><span class='line'>        \ressubitem{Undergraduate Graduation Date: May, 2008 (Summa Cum Laude, University Honors Scholar)}
</span><span class='line'>        \ressubitem{Masters GPA: 4.00}
</span><span class='line'>        \ressubitem{Masters Graduation Date: December, 2010}
</span><span class='line'>        \ressubitem{Currently pursuing Doctor of Philosophy in Mathematics at Auburn}
</span><span class='line'>    \end{ressubsec}
</span><span class='line'>\end{ressection}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>So began my search for a simpler way. My first instinct was <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> - it&#8217;s what <a href="http://www.teloga.com">Teloga</a> uses, it&#8217;s what <a href="http://www.reddit.com">Reddit</a> uses, heck, it&#8217;s what this blog uses. And certainly this markup is a lot friendlier to read and edit:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>##Education
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>####Auburn University - Auburn, AL
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>* Bachelor's of Science in Mathematics (2008)

</span><span class='line'>* Doctoral Candidate in Mathematics
</span><span class='line'>    * Currently writing dissertation on limited information strategies in topological games</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>So I thought the simple thing to do would be to just make a page on this blog for the resume. And when I did, it didn&#8217;t look half bad either.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/U6xQ4.png"></p>

<p>The only problem&#8230; I&#8217;d probably need a PDF version as well, and maybe even have to print it at some point. Silly old media.</p>

<p>Now, keeping multiple copies of the same resume definitely violates <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself">DRY</a>; I wanted a slicker solution. So my first idea was to just print the webpage from Chrome and save it as a PDF.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/kdRdF.png"></p>

<p>Yikes.</p>

<p>So, the issue that Octopress&#8217;s default theme doesn&#8217;t have a nice print stylesheet is a topic for another day, but I figured there was someone else out there of a similar mind that would have already paved the way for a nice way to share a resume written in Markdown.</p>

<p>As it often does, the Google helped me find an answer earlier today: <a href="http://pseudoweb.net/2010/10/25/developing-your-resume/">http://pseudoweb.net/2010/10/25/developing-your-resume/</a></p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/nAmTh.png"></p>

<p>Looks nice, and it prints well too. Incidentally, Mr. Welch&#8217;s resume app makes use of this very cool Ruby gem called <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a> which I may need to look more into for simple apps. I&#8217;m new to Ruby (hey maybe I can add it to my resume now though) but hacking his app to do what I wanted was pretty straight forward.</p>

<p>I added a few extra variables to the configuration YAML to store the URL of the page itself and the URL of a QR Code image leading to that URL, which I use in a couple of nice extra features:</p>

<ol>
<li>If the page is printed, it adds a line to the top: &#8220;Optimized for web | http://resume_url&#8221;</li>
<li>A QR code floats in the upper right of the page, also linking to the digital version of the resume.</li>
</ol>


<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/2WrpD.png"></p>

<p>You can see it in action at <a href="http://resume.stevenclontz.com">my resume page</a>, and my forked version of the app can be found <a href="https://github.com/StevenClontz/Resume">on my Github</a>.</p>

<p>There are still a couple of tweaks that might be nice to have if I decide to work on this more later.</p>

<ul>
<li>It&#8217;d be preferable to have a script to burn a PDF from the resume.md Markdown file rather than using a browser printout, possibly leveraging LaTeX.</li>
<li>A simple change would be to move some of the basic data (name, address, etc.) into the configuration file to standardize the header.</li>
</ul>


<p>In the meantime, I hope you found all this interesting, and maybe I&#8217;ve inspired you to use revision control and Markdown to maintain your own resume!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hey everyone! Thanks for checking out my new blog*. After deciding I didn&#8217;t need to waste so much cash on domain names I don&#8217;t use and web space I barely needed, I took down stevenclontz.com along with most of my other old PHP/Wordpress sites. I&#8217;ll get stevenclontz.com to point here sometime soon.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="http://jdabbs.com">James Dabbs</a> for showing <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> to me the other day - a blogging system with <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> revision control and hosting by <a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a> sounds alright to me.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll be working on my <a href="http://stevenclontz.herokuapp.com/about/">About</a> page and getting my <a href="http://resume.stevenclontz.com">Resume</a> up to date over the coming days.  Email me at <a href="&#109;&#x61;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#x73;&#116;&#101;&#118;&#x65;&#x6e;&#x2e;&#99;&#108;&#111;&#110;&#x74;&#x7a;&#x40;&#x67;&#109;&#97;&#x69;&#x6c;&#46;&#x63;&#x6f;&#109;">&#x73;&#x74;&#x65;&#x76;&#x65;&#x6e;&#x2e;&#x63;&#108;&#x6f;&#110;&#116;&#122;&#x40;&#103;&#109;&#x61;&#105;&#x6c;&#46;&#x63;&#111;&#x6d;</a> if you need to get in touch with me! See ya.</p>
